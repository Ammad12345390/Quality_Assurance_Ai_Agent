🧪 Quality Assurance Project
📋 Overview

This project focuses on implementing Quality Assurance (QA) practices to ensure the reliability, performance, and functionality of software systems.
The goal is to identify defects early in the development cycle and maintain high product quality through systematic testing and continuous improvement.

🎯 Objectives

Ensure the software meets all functional and non-functional requirements.

Detect and document defects effectively.

Implement test automation (if applicable) to speed up regression testing.

Improve code quality, security, and user experience.

Provide a comprehensive QA report to the development team.
